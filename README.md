# Deploy FastAPI backend to serve mock images

This repository provides a **FastAPI backend** to serve mock images with randomly generated objects. Each image can contain up to 3 objects, with two label categories: **Color** and **Shape**. The goal is to annotate these images by drawing bounding boxes and assigning labels for each object.

## Features
**FastAPI Backend**: Serves mock images via the endpoint `GET /get-mock-image`.
   - Images will contain 1 to 3 objects.
   - Each object will be generated by taking one from the following avaliable categories:
     - **Color**: Red, Blue, Green, or Black.
     - **Shape**: Square, or Circle.
   - Each response includes a unique image ID in the headers.

   - **Access Swagger Documentation:** Open your browser and navigate to: https://demo-omega-lovat.vercel.app/docs

## Goal:
**Frontend Annotation Tool**: Design a frontend application to:
   - Fetch images from the backend.
   - Allow users to draw bounding boxes.
   - Assign labels for **Color** and **Shape** categories to each boxes.
   - Send the annotations to `POST /submit-bbox`. Refer to swagger docs for schema.

Feel free to use any library to make this work. An exaple of such library that can be used is here [Annotorious React](https://annotorious.dev/react/custom-popups/) for bounding box creation and labeling.
